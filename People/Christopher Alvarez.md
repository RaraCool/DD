Referring to [an article](https://brooklyneagle.com/articles/2024/05/13/the-drake-kendrick-lamar-social-media-firestorm-that-burned-one-reporters-reputation/)that would later be published on the Brooklyn Eagle's website, for which he works.
In this article, [[Christopher Alvarez|Alvarez]] claims that no wrongdoing occurred that night, and he felt safe with [[Drake]]. He mentions that he was with him that night for dinner, despite the fact that the CCTV footage showed him in the hotel at 3AM. Much of the article talks about the dangers of misinformation online.

Later that night, [[Christopher Alvarez|Alvarez]] would go on Instagram Live to host a [Q&A session](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19yyddFGGnI3zZEhTyZIo1iAgCYz2Lf_k) about the article.
